# Mass Email Lookup with an easy-to-use UI
This repository contains an Email Lookup Tool that leverages the Perplexity API to retrieve contact information such as email addresses, phone numbers, and sources for individuals from an Excel file. The GUI for the tool is built using PySide6 for a modern, frameless interface with dark mode support, and it includes API key storage encryption.

  * `FirstName`
